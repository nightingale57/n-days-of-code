## Day 0

I once went on a course where a friend told me that the first day was day 0 - appropriately, since the course included some programming. 
Day 0 was the trial run day - about setting up and getting ready... 

So today, I am setting up my Github pages site for ***n days of code*** - inspired by the #100daysofcode on Twitter. Let's see what *n* becomes!
