## Day 1

Data visualisation is one of my favourite things! There are so many ways to think about how you can display a dataset, and different approaches will highlight different aspects of your data. 

Yet, for all the fun and blue skies parts of data visualisation, sometimes you just need to plot a simple graph to good effect. 

So for *Day 1* (at last - it's been many days since Day 0), I thought I would start looking at some of the simple yet effective graphs, and the little tricks that I've picked up while doing data vis.
