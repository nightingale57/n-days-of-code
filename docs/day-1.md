## Day 1

Data visualisation is one of my favourite things! There are so many ways to think about how you can display a dataset, and different approaches will highlight different aspects of your data. 

Yet, for all the fun and blue skies parts of data visualisation, sometimes you just need to plot a simple graph to good effect. 

So for *Day 1* (at last - it's been many days since Day 0), I thought I would start looking at some of the simple yet effective graphs, and the little tricks that I've picked up while doing data vis. 


### Tools
I like to work with [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) - it's open source, and it has great functionality, as well as add-ons for different programming languages and changing the display. 
It allows you to use [Conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/) to manage your packages, and you can work in the terminal and in your code at the same time (including on a cluster). It also has [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org/), which I really enjoy when I'm exploring my data. 


#### Colour picking
Colours (and where applicable textures) are really important to bringing out the stories in the data. Choosing one colour for a particular feature, and carrying on with that throughout visualisation helps to keep the mind focused on the story behind the data, rather than trying to reorient every time to what colour represents what. 

The other thing to take into account is of course *colour blindness*. Red-green is the most common kind, but it's worth using tools to check if your colours will be distinguishable to all of your intended audience.  

Great colour tools that I have found include:
* [html color codes](https://htmlcolorcodes.com/color-picker/)
* [Color Brewer](https://colorbrewer2.org)
* [Coolors](https://coolors.co) - as well as palette picking, this has a great feature for showing what a certain palette looks like to people with different kinds of colour blindness
