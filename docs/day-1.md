## Day 1

Data visualisation is one of my favourite things! There are so many ways to think about how you can display a dataset, and different approaches will highlight different aspects of your data. 

Yet, for all the fun and blue skies parts of data visualisation, sometimes you just need to plot a simple graph to good effect. 

So for *Day 1* (at last - it's been many days since Day 0), I thought I would start looking at some of the simple yet effective graphs, and the little tricks that I've picked up while doing data vis. 


### Tools
I like to work with [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) - it's open source, and it has great functionality, and add-ons for different programming languages and changing the display. 
It allows you to use [Conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/) to manage your packages, and you can work in the terminal and in your code at the same time (including on a cluster). It also has [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org/), which I really enjoy when I'm exploring my data.
